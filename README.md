The Sport Daily company provides information about sporting events related to the six
professional sport leagues in North America, such as the NBA, MLB, NFL, CFL, NHL, and
MLS. These professional sport leagues host an approximately 88,000 game events annually.
Sports Daily aims to create a database driven website to display and record detailed information
over the approximately 88,000 sports events hosted by these leagues by using external APIs to
gather real-time sports data, reducing the need to reach customers through physical media by
65% and increasing ad revenue by $250,000 through attracting new clients. Details will include
the sport being played, the teams, the players, the league, the venue, and streaming services. By
doing so, the companyâ€™s 40,000 customers will be able to easily find sporting events according to
their favorite sport, team, or player. In addition, customers can see upcoming events in their
chosen venue or find sports channels to view them from home.
